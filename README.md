<h2>CCleaner Free-Crack</h2>
<p><strong>CCleaner is a utility for cleaning junk in the operating system. In the course of its work CCleaner (Crap Cleaner) searches for and removes temporary and unused files. This includes: cookies, IE browsing history, temporary Internet files, search strings, Recycle Bin files, etc. It can also search for temporary files of third-party applications such as Firefox, Opera, Media Player, eMule, Kazaa, Google Toolbar, Netscape, Office XP, Nero, Alcohol 120, Adobe Acrobat, WinRAR, WinAce, WinZip, GetRight, Morpheus, Download Accelerator Plus, VirtualDub, ZoneAlarm and many others. You can also clean the Windows registry, ridding it of unnecessary extensions, old dll libraries and incorrect paths, which accumulate in large numbers, especially after installing and uninstalling a variety of programs. By doing all these operations on your system, you will not only free up disk space, but also increase the performance of the system as a whole.</p>
